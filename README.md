# Dockerized Flux Control Panel (FluxCP) for hercules servers.
This repository is a Docker build of [FluxCP](https://github.com/RolandKaechele/FluxCP), an open-source control panel for [hercules] server software.

  * Build features:
    * Uses [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) as base image.
    * Builds from the master branch of FluxCP's Github repository.
  * Runtime features:
    * Session state is stored in process memory, so this image won't scale easily without proper modification.
    * It uses the same MySQL database as the hercules server
    * The image leverages [NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/) web server and [PHP-FPM](https://php-fpm.org/) through [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/).

## File description

  * **build.bat**. Trivial script that launches docker build.
  * **Dockerfile**. The core of this repo, documented with the LABEL entries.
  * **docker-entrypoint.sh**. The Docker entrypoint that leaves the container in the desired state for execution.
  * **nginx.conf**. The NGINX configuration files, using the PHP-FPM model.
  * **supervisord.conf**. Supervisord configuration file.

## Requeriments
FluxCP requires a hercules server database in order to work.
The image is based on Alpine Linux and targets to run at Linux x64 architectures.

Footprint is really small.

## Environment variables accepted by the image

  * MYSQL_HOST. Hostname of the MySQL database. Ex: calnus-beta.mysql.database.azure.com.
  * MYSQL_DB. Name of the MySQL database.
  * MYSQL_USER. Database username for authentication.
  * MYSQL_PWD. Password for authenticating with database. WARNING: it will be visible from Azure Portal.
  * SVR_LOGIN_ADDR. Login Server IP address or DNS name.
  * SVR_CHAR_ADDR. Char Server IP address or DNS name.
  * SVR_MAP_ADDR. Map Server IP address or DNS name.
  * INSTALLER_PWD. Installer password.

## Usage
If you have a readily accesible hercules's MySQL sever and the hercules server itself, then usage is straight forward:

```
docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped -e MYSQL_HOST="MYSQL host IP" -e MYSQL_USER="MySQL username" -e MYSQL_PWD="MySQL password" -e MYSQL_DB="hercules"  -e SVR_LOGIN_ADDR="10.0.0.3" -e SVR_CHAR_ADDR="10.0.0.3" -e SVR_MAP_ADDR="10.0.0.3" -e INSTALLER_PWD="p4ss@w0rd" --name hercules-fluxcp cmilanf/docker-hercules-fluxcp:latest
```
